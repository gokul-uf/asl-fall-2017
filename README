Repository Overview
------------------

1. scripts 
  has all the scripts to run experiments, extract and plot graphs with subfolders corresponding to each of the sections in the report
  the automated experiments runner scripts are in the 1_exp_runners subdirectory
  Also has setup files used to install packages in the VMs

  call ./main_runner.sh from within this directory to recreate the CSVs and plots in each of the subdirectorys.
  NOTE please comment out the "mw_folder_postprocessor.py" and "mv" lines in order to make sure that raw middleware logs are not processed. These are done already and the processed files are in the
  logs/*/mw_log directories. These are several GBs big and are not provided in the repo. I will be happy to provide them if needed. Only section 5, gets and multi-gets have their raw files included because they need to be used to plot the histogram. Please extract it before running the main_runner.sh script

2. src

3. images
  images and plots used in the report, these are generated by scripts in the scripts/ directory but are manually moved to this folder.
